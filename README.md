# Introduction

Propertize is a Figma plugin designed to bridge the gap between design and data for the delaware designers. With Propertize, designers can now incorporate real data into their designs, providing them with a more accurate sense of how the final product will look like and function.

The plugin offers an intuitive interface that allows designers to connect seamlessly to a database containing up-to-date product data and populate their designs with it, reducing the time spent on manual data entry and ensuring greater accuracy in the design process.

Propertize can read and retrieve data from delaware's operational data store and display it within its interface.

Propertize features an annotation tool that displays metadata alongside the design mockup, providing users with additional information about the data's origin and format. This feature allows the designers to have a better understanding of the real data used, and make more informed design decisions based on that information.

Propertize was conceived with the reason of replacing complex and cluttered data tables on the wiki with a Figma plugin directly applicable to designs. This allows the client to easily evaluate the data model alongside the design and facilitate discussion.
